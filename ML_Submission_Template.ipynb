Restaurant business in India is always evolving. More Indians are warming up to the idea of eating restaurant food whether by dining outside or getting food delivered. The growing number of restaurants in every state of India has been a motivation to inspect the data to get some insights, interesting facts and figures about the Indian food industry in each city. So, this project focuses on analysing the Zomato restaurant data for each city in India.\n",

Also, cluster the zomato restaurants into different segments. The data is vizualized as it becomes easy to analyse data at instant. The Analysis also solve some of the business cases that can directly help the customers finding the Best restaurant in their locality and for the company to grow up and work on the fields they are currently lagging in.\n",

Also known as data cleaning or data munging, data wrangling enables businesses to tackle more complex data in less time, produce more accurate results, and make better decisions. The exact methods vary from project to project depending upon your data and the goal you are trying to achieve. More and more organizations are increasingly relying on data wrangling tools to make data ready for downstream analytics."

Since there was more than 50% null values in collection feature, I removed the entire column because columns with a high percentage of null values are likely to have a lot of missing data, which can make it difficult to accurately analyze or make predictions based on the data.\n",

On analysing I found that feature like reviewer and reviewer total review had all null values, therefore I removed those two columns which made null values in other feature to zero except in review and reviewer followers columns.

This is because, as the number of features increases, the computational cost of clustering algorithms also increases. In addition, high dimensionality can lead to the \"curse of dimensionality\", where the data becomes sparse and the clusters become harder to identify. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, or LLE can help reduce the number of features while maintaining the important information in the data, making it easier to cluster and interpret the results."

These patterns, known as principal components, are linear combinations of the original features that are uncorrelated with each other. By using the first few principal components, which account for the majority of the variation in the data, one can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data while maintaining most of the important information.\n",

Additionally, PCA can be used for data visualization by projecting high-dimensional data onto a 2D or 3D space for easy visualization.\n",

The advantage of this approach is that it can help to remove noise and correlated features from the data, which can make the clustering results more interpretable.
